It is produced through the high-speed spinning of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) chips, resulting in partially oriented molecular structures. POY requires further processing, typically texturizing or draw-warping, before being used in fabrics.","key_specifications":{"Denier Range":"50D - 1000D","Filament Count":"24F - 288F","Luster":["Semi-Dull (SD)","Bright (BR)","Trilobal Bright (TBR)","Full Dull (FD)"],"Cross-Section":["Round","Trilobal"],"Color":["Raw White","Dope Dyed Black","Other Dope Dyed Colors"],"Tenacity":"Low to Medium","Elongation":"High (typically >100%)"},"applications":["Manufacturing Drawn Textured Yarn (DTY)","Draw-warping for direct weaving or knitting (less common)","Feedstock for Air Textured Yarn (ATY)"]},"DTY":{"full_name":"Polyester Drawn Textured Yarn (DTY)","short_description":"DTY is produced by simultaneously drawing and texturizing Polyester POY.
